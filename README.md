📌 Project Overview

Payroll management is a critical business function involving salary computation, attendance tracking, leave management, and compliance. Manual payroll systems are prone to errors, fraud, and inefficiencies.

This project applies Machine Learning (ML) to build an Intelligent Payroll System that:

Predicts employee salaries

Identifies employees at risk of attrition

Detects payroll anomalies and potential fraud

Provides actionable business insights for HR and Finance teams



Objectives

Analyze payroll datasets using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Build ML models for salary prediction and attrition prediction

Detect salary and attendance anomalies

Transform payroll data into business-driven insights

Demonstrate how AI improves payroll accuracy and decision-making
